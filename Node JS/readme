Q.1 : What is Node JS ?
Ans : Node JS is an open-Source , cross-plateform JavaScript runtime enviroment
=>  Open Source : Source code is publicly availble for sharing and modification
=>  Cross plateform : Availble on MAC , Window and Linux
=>  JavaScript run time enviroment : Provides all the necessary components in order to use and run a JavaScript program outside the browser

=========================================================================================================================================================================

Why learn Node JS ?
 => Build end-to-end JavaScript applications
 => A numnber of major companies have migrated from other backend technologies to Node.JS
 => Full-Stack development is one of the most sought out skill sets by companies
 => Huge community support

=========================================================================================================================================================================

History of Node JS : 
    =>  In 1993 , the first web browswer with a user interface called Mosaic was relesed
    =>  In 1994 , the lead developer of Mosaic founded a company called NETSCAPE and released a more polished browser called NETSCAPE Navigator
    =>  Web pages could only be static and there was no interactive after a page eas loaded
    =>  In 1995 , NETSCAPE created a new scripting language called JavaScript
    =>  The name was purely for marketing purpose as Java was the hot new language back then

=========================================================================================================================================================================

The Advent of MicroSoft

    =>  In 1995 , Microdoft debuted their browser Internet Explorer
    =>  MicroSoft realised that JavaScript fundamentally changed the user experience of the web and wanted the same for internet explorer
    =>  But there was no specification for them to follow
    => In 1996 , Microsoft reversed-engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own scripting language called JScript
    => The diffrence made it difficult for developer to make their website work well in both browsers
    => "Best viewed in  netscape" and "Best viewed in internet Explorer" badges became common

=========================================================================================================================================================================

ECAM International


    =>  In Nov 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International
    =>  It is an industry association dedicated to the standardization of information and communication systems
    =>  Netscape wanted a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to as it would help keep other implementations consistent across browsers
    =>  For each new specification Ecma provides a standard specification and a committee
    =>  In case of JavaScript, the standard is called ECMA-262 and the committee that works on ECMA-262 is called Technical Committee 39 (TC39)

=========================================================================================================================================================================

Ecma International contd.

    =>  Ecma however decided to use the term "ECMAScript" to talk about the official language
    =>  The reason for this is because Oracle (who acquired Microsystems) owns the trademark for the term "JavaScript"
    =>  ECMAScript refers to the standard language whereas JavaScript is what we use in practice and builds on top of ECMAScript

=========================================================================================================================================================================

ECMAScript versions
    =>  1997 - ECMAScript 1
    =>  1998 - ECMAScript 2
    =>  1999 - ECMAScript 3
    =>  ECMAScript 4 never released
    =>  2009 - ECMAScript 5
    =>  2015 - ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)
    =>  One version every year since 2015

=========================================================================================================================================================================

ECMAScript Summary

    =>  ECMA-262 is the language specification
    =>  ECMAScript is the language that implements ECMA-262
    =>  JavaScript is basically ECMAScript at its core but builds on top of that

=========================================================================================================================================================================

JavaScript Engine
    =>  JavaScript code we write cannot be understood by the computer
    =>  A JavaScript engine is a program that converts javascript code that developers write into machine code that allows a  computer to perform specific tasks
    =>  JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors
        > V8 - Open-source JavaScript Engine developed by Google for Chrome
        > SpiderMonkey - The JavaScript Engine powering Mozilla Firefox
        > JavaScriptCore - Open-source JavaScript Engine developed by Apple for Safari
        > Chakra - A JavaScript Engine for the original Microsoft Edge (The latest version of edge uses V8)


=========================================================================================================================================================================

Chrome's V8 Engine & Node.js

    =>  Chrome's V8 engine by Google sits at the core of Node.js
    =>  By embedding V8 into your own C++ application, you can write C++ code thar gets executed when a user writes JavaScript code
    =>  You can add new features to JavaScript itself
    =>  Since C++ is great for lower level operations like file handling, database connections and network operations, by embedding V8 into your own C++ program, you have the power to add all of that functionality in JavaScript

    =>  The C++ program we're talking about is Node.js*

* Node.js is a lot more than just a C++ program


=========================================================================================================================================================================

Chrome's V8 Engine Summary

    =>  A JavaScript engine is a program that executes JavaScript code
    =>  In 2008, Google created its own JavaScript engine called V8
    =>  V8 is written in C++ and can be used independently or can be embedded into other C++ programs
    =>  That allows you to write your own C++ programs which can do everything that V8 can do and more
    =>  Your C++ program can run ECMAScript and additional features that you choose to incorporate
    
For example, features that are available in C++ but not available with JavaScript


=========================================================================================================================================================================

JavaScript Runtime

    =>  JavaScript runtime is an environment which provides all the necessary components in order to use and run a JavaScript program
    =>  Every browser has a JavaScript Engine
    =>  A JavaScript Engine is one component in the JavaScript Runtime
    
    What else does the JavaScript Runtime consist of?

Concepts so far
    =>  ECMAScript
    =>  JavaScript Engine
    =>  JavaScript Runtime

What can you build with Node.js?
    ● Traditional websites
    ● Backend services like APIs
    ● Real-time applications
    ● Streaming services
    ● CLI tools
    ● Multiplayer games
Node.js allows you to build complex and powerful applications




Node.js Summary
    ● Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment
    ● It is not a language, it is not a framework
    ● Capable of executing JavaScript code outside a browser
    ● It can execute not only the standard ECMAScript language but also new features that are made available through C++ bindings using the V8 engine
    ● It consists of C++ files which form the core features and JavaScript files which expose common utilities and some of the C++ features for easier consumption
